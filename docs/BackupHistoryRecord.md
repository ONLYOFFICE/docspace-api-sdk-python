# BackupHistoryRecord
One stored backup of a portal.

## Properties

Name | Type | Description | Notes
------------ | ------------- | ------------- | -------------
**id** | **UUID** | The ID of the backup, which is the same value as the `taskId` the backup was started with. Pass it to  `DELETE api/2.0/backup/deletebackup/{id}` or as the `backupId` of  `POST api/2.0/backup/startrestore`. | 
**file_name** | **str** | The name of the stored archive. It is built from the portal alias and the moment the backup started,  or from `workspace` instead of the alias for a backup of the whole server. | 
**storage_type** | [**BackupStorageType**](BackupStorageType.md) | The storage the archive was written to, reported as a number rather than as a name. | 
**created_on** | **datetime** | The date and time the backup was stored at, in UTC. | 
**expires_on** | **datetime** | The date and time a background cleaner removes this backup at. Only a backup written to `DataStore`  expires, one day after it was stored; for every other storage type this is `0001-01-01T00:00:00`,  which means the backup is kept until it is deleted by hand or pushed out by the stored-copies limit  of a schedule. | 

## Example

```python
from docspace_api_sdk.models.backup_history_record import BackupHistoryRecord

# TODO update the JSON string below
json = "{}"
# create an instance of BackupHistoryRecord from a JSON string
backup_history_record_instance = BackupHistoryRecord.from_json(json)
# print the JSON string representation of the object
print(BackupHistoryRecord.to_json())

# convert the object into a dict
backup_history_record_dict = backup_history_record_instance.to_dict()
# create an instance of BackupHistoryRecord from a dict
backup_history_record_from_dict = BackupHistoryRecord.from_dict(backup_history_record_dict)
