# **continue_portal**
> continue_portal()

Brings a deactivated portal back to the active state, so its users can sign in again and its domain serves the
portal as before. It is reached only with the reactivation link that `POST api/2.0/portal/suspend` mails to
the portal owner: that link authorizes the call in place of an authentication token, and no ordinary token is
accepted here. The call is mutating and idempotent - it sets the status to active, re-applies the portal's
Content Security Policy and refreshes its base domain, and a portal that is already active is simply left
active. Nothing is returned in the body; read the result from `status` in `GET api/2.0/portal`. Deactivating
the portal again means asking for a fresh letter with `POST api/2.0/portal/suspend`, because each link is
issued for one operation. This operation cannot bring back a removed portal: the deletion behind
`DELETE api/2.0/portal/delete` is final, and a removed portal has to be restored from a backup instead.

# **delete_portal**
> StringWrapper delete_portal()

Removes this portal for good: its rooms, files, accounts, settings and OAuth clients go with it and its domain
stops serving the portal. It is reached only with the removal link that `POST api/2.0/portal/delete` mails to
the portal owner - that link authorizes the call instead of an authentication token - and the owner is checked
again here; on a server installation the last remaining space cannot be removed. The call is destructive and
cannot be undone, and there is no restore operation, so take a backup with `POST api/2.0/backup/startbackup`
first when the content still matters. It keeps working while the portal's payment has lapsed. Along the way
the portal is dropped from the hosting cache, the owner is mailed a confirmation, the removal is written to
the audit trail and, for a portal that was paying, the support team is notified as well. The answer is the
absolute URL of the feedback form to send the departing owner to. To pause the portal instead of erasing it,
use `PUT api/2.0/portal/suspend`.

# **get_portal_information**
> TenantWrapper get_portal_information()

Returns the portal the request was addressed to - the tenant behind the current domain - with its name, alias,
owner, language, time zone, industry, trusted-domain rules, version and creation date. Nothing has to be
called first, the call is read-only and idempotent, and it keeps answering while the portal's payment has
lapsed. What comes back depends on the caller's rights: a caller with the portal-settings right gets the whole
record, while every other user gets an object in which only `tenantId` is filled and no error is raised - so
check `tenantAlias` for null before reading the rest. `status` says whether the portal is active, suspended or
pending removal, and `creationDateTime`, `statusChangeDate`, `lastModified` and `versionChanged` are UTC.
`region` names the data-center region a hosted portal is served from and stays empty on a server installation
and when the portal cache is off, while `hostedRegion` is the region written on the record itself. The
settings of the same portal are read with `GET api/2.0/settings`, its tariff with `GET api/2.0/portal/tariff`
and its quota with `GET api/2.0/portal/quota`.

# **get_portal_path**
> StringWrapper get_portal_path(virtual_path=virtual_path)

Turns a portal-relative path into the absolute URL a client can open, filling in the scheme, the current
portal domain and the virtual root the portal is hosted on. Any signed-in user may call it, nothing has to be
called first, and the call is read-only and idempotent - it neither checks that the path exists nor that the
caller is allowed to open it. `virtualPath` is taken as it is: an omitted or empty value yields the portal
root, a value starting with `/` is appended to that root, a value starting with `~/` is resolved against the
virtual root, and a value that already starts with `http://`, `https://` or `mailto:` is handed back
unchanged. The answer is a bare JSON string. The domain in the result is the one the portal answers on right
now, so a renamed portal starts returning the new domain without any change on the client. Use it to build
links that have to survive a rename; the portal's own addresses and settings are read from
`GET api/2.0/settings` instead.

For more information, see [api.onlyoffice.com]().

### Parameters

# **send_delete_instructions**
> send_delete_instructions()

Mails the portal owner the confirmation link that removes this portal; nothing about the portal changes until
that link is used. The caller has to be the portal owner and hold the portal-settings right, and on a server
installation the last remaining space cannot be removed - the call is refused when every other space has
limited access. The letter goes to the owner's own address whoever asked for it, and it warns about the
subscription that will stop renewing when the portal is on a paid plan. The operation keeps working while the
portal's payment has lapsed, is mutating only in that it sends a message, and is rate-limited to five requests
per fifteen minutes per user and path by default, answering 429 above that. Nothing is returned in the body.
The link in the letter authorizes `DELETE api/2.0/portal/delete`, which deletes the portal with all of its
rooms, files and accounts and cannot be undone. To pause the portal instead of deleting it, send the
deactivation letter with `POST api/2.0/portal/suspend`.

# **send_suspend_instructions**
> send_suspend_instructions()

Mails the portal owner the two confirmation links that deactivate this portal and bring it back again, and
records the request in the audit trail; the portal itself is not changed here. The caller has to be the portal
owner and hold the portal-settings right, and on a server installation the last remaining space cannot be
deactivated - the call is refused when every other space has limited access. The letter always goes to the
owner's own address, and the operation keeps working while the portal's payment has lapsed. It is mutating
only in that it sends a message, and it is rate-limited to five requests per fifteen minutes per user and path
by default, answering 429 above that. Nothing is returned in the body, so a client cannot tell from the answer
whether the mail was delivered. The first link in the letter authorizes `PUT api/2.0/portal/suspend`, which
suspends the portal, and the second one authorizes `PUT api/2.0/portal/continue`, which makes it active again.
To remove the portal instead of pausing it, use `POST api/2.0/portal/delete`.

# **suspend_portal**
> suspend_portal()

Deactivates this portal: its status becomes suspended and its users can no longer work in it, while all of its
rooms, files and accounts stay untouched. It is reached only with the deactivation link that
`POST api/2.0/portal/suspend` mails to the portal owner - that link authorizes the call instead of an
authentication token - and the owner is checked again here, so a link issued for another account is refused.
On a server installation the last remaining space cannot be deactivated. The call is mutating and idempotent:
it sets the status, records the deactivation in the audit trail and refreshes the portal's base domain, and
repeating it leaves the portal suspended. Nothing is returned in the body; the new state is read from `status`
in `GET api/2.0/portal`. Bring the portal back with `PUT api/2.0/portal/continue`, using the second link from
the same letter. To remove the portal and its content for good, use `DELETE api/2.0/portal/delete` instead -
that cannot be undone.
